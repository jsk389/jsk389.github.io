The eras of TESS and PLATO will provide new challenges for evolutionary state classification of red-giant stars (i.e. red-giant branch vs. core helium burning) given the large number of stars being observed and the short datasets. We propose a new method based upon a supervised classification scheme that uses only "summary statistics" of the timeseries to predict the evolutionary state. Applying this to red giants in the APOKASC catalogue, we obtain a classification accuracy of ~93% for the full 4 years of Kepler data. The method also generalises to shorter datasets; it achieves an accuracy greater than 92% for subsets of the Kepler data with durations that mimic CoRoT (180 days), K2 (80 days) and TESS data (27 days). This work helps to pave the way towards fast, reliable classification of vast amounts of data with a few, well-engineered features. We also show how these features can be applied beyond solar-like oscillators and used in more general stellar classification tasks.
